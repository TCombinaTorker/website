    Functional Programming
    </h1>
    
    <p>Functional paradigm is my favorite programming paradigm. I excel Haskell at most. If you are interested in
    <u><b> Functional Pearls</b></u>, you may gladly

    <h1>Linguistics Applications</h2>
    <p>
        A <u><b> linguistics aplication</b></u> is an application that requires processing of a natural or computational language (human languages, script languages or programming languages). Most popular computational linguistics applications
        are Information retrieval applications (so called search engines), translators and interpreters.

    <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
    <p>There is no doubt that linear algebra is the most fundamental part of information science. Algebra helps us by representing abstract software objects. And linear algebra offers representation of linear vector spaces which represents 2d and
        3d models of scientific or realistic models.</p>
